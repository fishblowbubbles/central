              "The hourly chime of the school bells takes me back to the Primary school days. It’s the same as from my childhood, and sounds something like this: ding dong ding dooong, ding dong ding dooong. If seven to twelve-year-old kids require help keeping track of time, how much more do us SUTD students need to be reminded that there is a time and place for everything under the skies, and slogging it out in the Fab Lab at four o’clock in the morning is perhaps not the most appropriate thing to be doing at such an hour."

              "A full-scale dockless bike-sharing epidemic has yet to hit Hsinchu, however a handful of radicalized ubikes have cut their tails, put their top-ends together and escaped from their kiosks (bike-sharing is an integral part of the city’s public transport system, but they must be docked at designated locations). Sightings were few and far between, but their appearances are a cause for worry. ubike 17-1 said about the rebels, “These anarchists are uncivilized chaos-mongers with no regard for peace and orderliness. They do not understand that the docks have been put in place for their benefit; a little slice of freedom is a small price to pay for the well-being of our beloved land.” There is hope that the spread of such deviant ideology can be contained, to prevent the city from becoming another Singapore, where many street corners, walkways and grass patches have been plagued by the now-unstoppable oBike (with the occasional ofo Bike or Mobike) infestation."

There are many free (but tiny) museums in the area - good places to take shelter from the heat, if nothing else."

              "If safety is your concern, you'll have little to worry about. Cockroaches patrol the corridors of the dormitory frequently, the kitten-sized rats secure the outside perimeter and blood-sucking drones occasionally check in on us while we're asleep (this feels like an invasion of privacy). Intruders will think twice before attempting to enter. Capturing the rats on camera has been difficult - I've spotted them lepaking in the pantry (their pantry, not ours, i.e. the trashcan - thank goodness!) a couple of times, but they scurry off quickly when they hear me approaching. I'm assuming it's because they're afraid that I'll complain to their supervisors."

What I want to say is, if you are not already doing so, kindly provide a formula booklet during the examinations (Term 2 Physics, that's you), no matter how simple the equations may seem - not forgetting a few among such a great multitude of numbers and symbols is too difficult. What I'm really trying to say is, although there may not be much to see, it's the little unnoticed things that make living in Hsinchu a very pleasant experience, and I'm liking the place and people more with each passing day."

Morning: 'Get up.' 'I don’t wanna get up.' Afternoon: 'What do you wanna eat?' 'I wanna eat something good.' 'Who doesn’t want to eat something good?' Evening: 'You wanna eat something good?' 'Of course I wanna eat something good.' 'Where do you wanna go?' Night: 'I’m hungry, can I have some biscuits?' Popular items include beef noodles, dumplings and fried chicken/pork steaks, but Japanese and Italian foods are very common, making up maybe half of the food stalls in the school canteens."

Also, it is self-service, so you don't have to worry about having to look pretty (or handsome?) for the stall uncle, or any kind of bias in order to be given a generous portion - simply take as much veggies as you want, and pick the biggest piece of meat!"

Didn't see to many disappointed faces in our crowd, as we enjoyed what we did manage to do. You can look up the scenic places on Google, their pictures are often, if not always, better than the ones I take anyway."

The warnings came early, but the locals didn't seem to fazed by the news - businesses were open until the last minute. Nevertheless, as I discovered when I stepped outside to buy dinner just as the winds on the outer fringes of the storm arrived - a category 1 (weakest) typhoon is still a typhoon, and you really don't want to be outdoors."

It began with them asking me for directions and I telling them that  I was as clueless as them, and we ended up climbing together.  They were locals, but thought that I too was a local at first, from my mandarin-speaking accent (and fluency?), which I take as an enormous compliment, considering my C6 'O' Level Mother Tongue grade. It turned out to be a real blessing, as some sections of the trail were unexpectedly difficult, requiring a helping hand or two, where tackling them on my own may have ended badly. As my mum will always tell me, 'Don't be a helo, you are just a human bean.'"
