It turned out to be a real blessing, as some sections of the trail were unexpectedly difficult, requiring a helping hand or two, where tackling them on my own may have ended badly. As my mum will always tell me, 'Don't be a helo, you are just a human bean.'"

Sightings were few and far between, but their appearances are a cause for worry. ubike 17-1 said about the rebels, “These anarchists are uncivilized chaos-mongers with no regard for peace and orderliness. They do not understand that the docks have been put in place for their benefit; a little slice of freedom is a small price to pay for the well-being of our beloved land.” There is hope that the spread of such deviant ideology can be contained, to prevent the city from becoming like Singapore, where many street corners, walkways and grass patches have been plagued by the now-unstoppable oBike (with the occasional ofo Bike or Mobike) infestation."
